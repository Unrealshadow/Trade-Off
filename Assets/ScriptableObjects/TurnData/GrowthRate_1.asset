  text_1: You burned through the IPO cash to expand as quickly as possible. Your
    rapid growth makes headlines and impresses your shareholders.
  text_2: You knew your team could deliver and they did. FlexBird's share price growth
    delights your early investors.
  text_3: You missed analysts' expectations, but the cash you raised in the IPO gives
    you some buffer against a falling share price.
  text_4: You came nowhere near to meeting analysts' expectations. It is not a great
    start to life as a public company.
